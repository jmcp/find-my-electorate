About this repo
---------------

This repo contains a Flask app (eventually) which maps an Australian
street address into Federal and State/Territory electorates. The JSON-
formatted data depends upon downloads from the various Electoral
Commissions and have been processed with scripts from my [grabbag][grabbag]
repository.

All code in this repo is available for you to use under the
terms of the MIT license. Please review [LICENSE][LICENSE] for details.
